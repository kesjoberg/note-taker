## Description
The objective of this assignment was to add server and html routes to a starter package of code to link the index and notes html pages as well as saving and retrieving data from the db.json file. I started by creating a route from the server.js file in the root of the file. Next, I created 3 files in the routes folder, an index file to send html and api requests to seperate files. Then I created the code to handle the api requests to create, save, and retrieve notes to the db.json file. Our last objective was to deploy the code to Heroku so that it could help with the server port.
